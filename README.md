# Log Parser

This is a log parser for ruby on rails  projects. It uses a database in SQLite and Rails 4.2.6 
 Log parser reads the log of a rails project an save its data in a model call Log, after formating it. 

##   Instalation

Log parser comes with its own vagrantfile, which provides an easy system to install the project. You only need to have instaled vagrant and virtualbox in your computer.

First clone the project in your local, then:

`

vagrant up

`

This will install the environment and the project dependencies.

To access to the project:

`
vagrant ssh
vagrant 
cd /vagrant
bundle install
bundle exec rails c
`

Of course you can install it by yourself as any other rails project.

## Configuration

You can add to your application.rb file:

`config.log_path = 'path-to-default-log-to-read'`


## How to use

Run:

`bundle exec rake parser:run_parser[path-to-logfile]`

if you donÂ´t specify a path to the logfile the system will take the path from application.rb file (if there is any).

You can initalize a Parser object from command line:

`parser = Parser.new(path, allow_assets = false)`

path : complete path of the log file
allow_assets : Flag that determines if the assets logs are treated or not (by default are not treated).


The program provides two methods that you can be used from command line to retrive data from the log file:
`
parser.read
parser.tail
`
read method read the log and persits data in Log model.
tail method read the log, persits data in Log model, and also keep listing the log file for ading new registres to the database.

You can see the results of the log parser in the root of the project accessing thought web. For example in local, after bundle exec rails s -b 0.0.0.0, you can see the list of logs recovery in http://localhost:3000 (notice that if you have more vagrant boxes up maybe the port can be different).

You also can see the results you can access to the console and do queries directly to the model. The UUID is unique and the primary key of the model/table. In each row is integrated all the revelant information about each UUID taked from the log file. 

## Testing

For running tests:

`rake`
